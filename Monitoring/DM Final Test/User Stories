As a user I want to be able to get a ticket once I register my mail.

DESCRIPTION

The user will be shown a form with the following elements (the placing from top to bottomm, one below the previous):
- A dropdown list containing the types of raffles.
- A text input for the user so he can wirte his email.
- A button with the label "Get Ticket" for the user to click on when he wants to get his ticket number.
- A label field for the user to see his ticket number.

UX steps:

1. First the user should choose the type of raffle he wants to participate in, choosing one from the drop down list.
2. Then he must write his email in the input field. This will be validated when the button is clicked on, so the mail has the following format: [name]@fundacion-jala.org
Where the [name] could contain lower and uppercase letters only from A to Z.
3. Then last When the user clicks on the "Get Ticket" button the input field will be validated.
4. If the validation checks out, the user will see his ticket number in the label field and the button will be disabled.
Otherwise he will get a error message saying "Incorrect email format" in the label field.
